					<p>The chart above shows the negative correlation between access to healthcare and those who are at the poverty level.
						Analysis is based on data from the US Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. There is a
						very general trend showing that states with lower levels of poverty have higher access to healthcare. For example,
						New Hampshire has the lowest poverty rate in the nation, and 88 percent of its residents have healthcare. Places like
						Missouri and New Mexico have the highest poverty rates in the nation, but more than 80 percent still have access to
						healthcare. One explanation for this could be the usage of Medicaid, which provides healthcare coverage for low income
						families, according to Medicaid.gov.</p>

					<p>There are states on that could be considered outliers, including Massachusetts and Texas. While Masschusetts does not
						have the lowest poverty level (but still is on the lower side of the graph), the healthcare rate is more than 95 percent.
						This is due to Massachusetts healthcare reform in the 2000s, which greatly expanded healthcare access to its residents.
						Texas, on the other side of the coin, does not have the lowest poverty rate in the nation, yet the least amount of
						its residents are uninsured. Texas did not partipcate in Medicaid expansion during the Obama error, which has limited
						many people's access, according to the Dallas Observer.</p>
